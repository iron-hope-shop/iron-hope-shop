## Featured Project: nHale

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/banner.gif" alt="nHale - A Modular, High-Performance Steganography and Steganalysis Toolkit" width="100%">
</div>

nHale is an advanced open-source toolkit I am developing in Rust for secure steganography **and steganalysis**. It enables secure message embedding, extraction, and forensic analysis across various file formats. The project provides a lightweight, efficient, and modular implementation of both steganographic and steganalysis algorithms, making it an ideal tool for cybersecurity professionals and digital forensics experts.

### Key Features
- 🔒 **Secure Embedding:** Support for PNG, JPG, and PDF files.
- 🔐 **Strong Encryption:** AES-256, ChaCha20, and RSA encryption support.
- ✅ **Data Integrity:** HMAC verification and Reed-Solomon error correction.
- 🔎 **Steganalysis:** Detect hidden data using statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and optional machine learning-based methods.
